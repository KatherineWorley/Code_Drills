REQUIRE
`require` reads and parses files only once, when they were referenced for the first time. (Runs off memory)
	It reads the file from the file system, parses it, saves to the memory and runs it in a given place. What does it mean? Simply, even if you change the required file when the script is running, those changes won't be applied - Ruby will use the file from memory, not from the file system.

LOAD
`load` reads and parses files every time you call `load`.

Note that we say filename not filename.rb mostly because not all extensions use files that ends with .rb


________________________________
test_module.rb
test_class.rb

can use the load 'test_module.rb' just before the class definition in test_class.rb file to get the access to the code contained in our module.
